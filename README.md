# Tracking-and-Analyzing-Dead-Kilometers-for-Uber-Drivers


Develop a system that can analyze historical trip data of Uber drivers to identify instances where drivers have 
Travelled Dead kilometers beyond a threshold value. The system will detect these deviations, quantify them against
established thresholds, and calculate appropriate fines for drivers who exceed the allowable limits. 

- Objectives :
1. To boost overall business performance while maintaining fairness and trustÂ between the Drivers and the Company.
2. To Calculate the Dead Kilometers and Penalizes the Drivers if it exceeds a certain limit. 

- Maximize :
1. The accuracy of Dead Kilometers detection.
2. Driver Retention
3. Profit Maximization
4. Customer Satisfaction

- Minimize : 
1. Dead Kilometres
2. Operational Costs : The cost associated because of Dead kilometres.

Overview of Challenges Faced by uber
- Concept of Dead Kilometers:

Definition: Dead kilometers refer to the distance traveled by a driver between the drop-off location of one trip 
and the starting point of the next trip without a passenger. These kilometers represent inefficient utilization 
of resources, as the driver is not earning during this travel time.

Cause: This typically occurs when a driver finishes a trip and needs to find another ride,
leading to an idle time where fuel is consumed without generating revenue.

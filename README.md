# Tracking-and-Analyzing-Dead-Kilometers-for-Uber-Drivers


Develop a system that can analyze historical trip data of Uber drivers to identify instances where drivers have 
Travelled Dead kilometers beyond a threshold value. The system will detect these deviations, quantify them against
established thresholds, and calculate appropriate fines for drivers who exceed the allowable limits.
